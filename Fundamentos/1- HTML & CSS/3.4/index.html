        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Mantis shrimps come in over 500 different kinds and come in a wide
          variety of sizes and hues. The mantis shrimp possesses a carapace, or
          shell, like other crustaceans do. Brown to brilliant rainbow colours
          are only a few of its many colors. The mantis shrimp matures at around
          10 centimeters (3.9 in) in length on average, although some grow to 38
          cm (15 in). One even measured 46 centimeters in length (18 in).
        </p>
        <p>
          The claws of the mantis shrimp are what set it apart from other
          species. The second set of appendages, called raptorial claws, can
          function as clubs or spears depending on the species. The mantis
          shrimp may stab or beat victims with its claws.

      <section id="vision">
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Even more so than butterflies, stomatopods have the most advanced
          eyesight in the animal kingdom. The compound eyes of the mantis shrimp
          are situated on stalks and may move independently of one another as it
          scans its environment. A mantis shrimp's eyes have between 12 and 16
          different types of photoreceptor cells, compared to humans' three
          types. Even some species can adjust how sensitive their color vision
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three sections are formed by the arrangement of the ommatidia, a group
          of photoreceptors, in parallel rows. Each eye receives trinocular
          vision and depth awareness as a result. Deep ultraviolet, visible
          light, and far red wavelengths are all observable to mantis shrimps.
          In addition, they can perceive polarized light. Circularly polarized
          light may be seen by some animals, a trait not shared by any other
          animal species. The ability to perceive and judge distance to
          shimmering or transparent things offers the mantis shrimp a survival
          edge in a setting that can range from bright to gloomy.

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          Mantis shrimp are very clever creatures. They are able to learn, they
          can know and recall other people by sight and scent. The social
          behavior of the animals is highly developed, and it involves
          ritualized fighting and synchronized actions between partners in a
          monogamous relationship. They communicate with one another and perhaps
          other species via fluorescent patterns.

      <section id="reprodution">
        <h3>Reproduction and Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>
          A mantis shrimp lives for 20 years on average. It could reproduce 20
          to 30 times in its lifespan. In some species, mating is the only time
          when men and females interact. Either the female deposits her eggs in
          her burrow or takes them with her wherever she goes. In unions that
          last a lifetime, both sexes care for the eggs in shrimp of different
          species. The young spend three months as zooplankton after hatching
          before molting into their adult form.

      <section id="diet">
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>
          The mantis shrimp is a lone, solitary predator for the most part.
          While others wait in their lairs, certain species aggressively follow
          their prey. With an astonishing acceleration of 102,000 m/s2 and a
          speed of 23 mps, the animal kills by swiftly extending its raptorial
          claws (51 mph). Since the attack happens so quickly, water between the
          shrimp and its victim boils, resulting in cavitation bubbles. When the
          bubbles burst, a shockwave is created that instantly exerts 1500
          newtons of force on the prey. Therefore, the shockwave can stun or
          kill the shrimp even if it misses its intended target.
          Sonoluminescence, a form of feeble light, is also produced by the
          collapsing bubble. Fish, snails, crabs, oysters, and other mollusks
          are common prey items. Mantis shrimps will consume other individuals
          of the same species.
